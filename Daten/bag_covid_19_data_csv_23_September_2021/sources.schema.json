After November 9th, no retroactive adjustments have been necessary.\nFor the entire time period, erroneous entries have been corrected manually in consultation with the hospitals and clinics.\nDepending on the prevalence of Covid-19 in Switzerland, hospitals are required to provide data between two times per week and two times per day. If multiple entries per day are reported, only the last entry is used in this dataset. If hospitals did not report data, the last entry is forward propagated to fill missing data points.\nThe data has been corrected as described above and aggregated on cantonal and national level with effectively reported values (nfp) and propagated values (fp7d).\n\nGiven that the reported patient numbers reported by hospitals are more reliable and accurate, the capacity data was retroactively adjusted to ensure a consistent dataset where capacity and patient numbers do not produce implausible results.",
